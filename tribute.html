<h1>Dale Carnegie </h1>
<h3 style="color:grey";>The Management Thinker</h3>

<main id="main">
<p id="tribute-info">Dale Carnegie (1888-1955) is best-known for his work on the basic, yet essential, principles for dealing with people successfully. His common-sense advice included never criticising, complaining about or condemning another person, giving sincere appreciation to others, and stimulating in others a specific desire, in order to motivate them.
</p>  
 
<p>
Such advice formed the basis of the best-selling book for which Carnegie has become famous, <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-summary"> How to win friends and influence people</a> (1936). In this text, Carnegie's simple rules on how to achieve success with people are illustrated from his own and others' experiences, and also with historical stories about people such as Roosevelt and Lincoln. Although he is mainly known for this particular book, Carnegie's career began with training people to become speakers and writing various other books. He produced some of the earliest self-improvement manuals, and these are still popular today.

Carnegie's main focus: 
<ul>
  <li>interpersonal skills</li> 
  <li>effective communication </li>
  <li>being a successful salesperson.</li></ul></p>
